## ‚ö° Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureSK-20.git
   cd SecureSK-20
   ```

2. **(Recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On **Windows**:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On **macOS/Linux**:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the tool:**
   ```bash
   python SecureSK-20.py
   ```

To deactivate the virtual environment when done, simply run:
```bash
deactivate
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Run the tool from your terminal:
```bash
python SecureSK-20.py
```

- Enter the number of the desired operation and follow the prompts.
- Password/secret input is hidden for security (except for Base64 encoding, which uses visible input).

## üì¶ Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `pycryptodome`
- `colorama`
- `requests`
- `argon2-cffi`

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üîí Security Notes
- Passwords are never displayed in the terminal (except for Base64 encoding, which uses visible input).
- All cryptographic operations use secure random salts and keys where applicable.
- For demo purposes, some algorithms (DES, Triple DES, ChaCha20, Fernet, RSA, ECC) use AES as a placeholder. For production use, replace with real implementations.
